get list of things based on bad/hard classification collections:

SELECT DISTINCT thing_id FROM lookbook_thing WHERE lookbook_id IN(2574093, 2574081, 4347652) ORDER BY thing_id;


turn thing IDs into image URLs:
SELECT thing_id  FROM lookbook_thing WHERE lookbook_id IN(2574093, 2574081, 4347652) ORDER BY thing_id;

fetch images for testing:

mkdir input_sources
pushd input_sources
cat ../thing_sources.txt | xargs -I{} -P4 curl -O http://ak1.polyvoreimg.com/cgi/img-thing/size/l/tid/{}.jpg
popd

mkdir input_masks
pushd input_masks
cat ../thing_sources.txt | xargs -I{} -P4 curl -O http://ak1.polyvoreimg.com/cgi/img-thing/mask/1/size/l/tid/{}.jpg
popd



results:
  59 better
  55 par
  17 other
  16 worse

other are either hard-to-categorize for either algorithm, or some other oddity:
 - better focus on item, to the detriment of the overall picture
 - equally bad masking on both algorithms
