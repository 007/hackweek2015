get list of things based on bad/hard classification collections:

SELECT DISTINCT thing_id FROM lookbook_thing WHERE lookbook_id IN(2574093, 2574081, 4347652) ORDER BY thing_id;


turn thing IDs into image URLs:
SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT('http://ak1.polyvoreimg.com/cgi/img-thing/size/l/tid/', thing_id, '.jpg') FROM lookbook_thing WHERE lookbook_id IN(2574093, 2574081, 4347652) ORDER BY thing_id;

fetch images for testing:

mkdir input_sources
cd input_sources
cat ../thing_sources.txt | xargs -I{} -P4 curl -O "{}"
